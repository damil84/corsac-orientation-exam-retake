Question:
-What is the difference between unit and integration testing?

Answer:
- Brief version:
Nomen est omen :) Unit test is for testing one unit of code. And integration test
is for testing how well working (or if working at all) a group of units together.
- Bit more detailed:
Unit test: it is to test an invidiual units of code to determine whether they are ready to use.
It is usually executed by developer, and it can be performed any time. Finding errors like this
usually easy, and cheap.
Integration test: we combine moduls in the application and test them as a group whether they can
working together fine. 
It is usually executed by a test team, and it is applied after unit testing, and before system
testing. It is more expensive, and finding errors a bit more difficult.
